# ProjectZ

## Overview
This project is a collection of retro games, aiming to revive the nostalgia of classic gaming. It currently consists of four different games:

- Bucket Ball
- Pacman
- Icy Tower
- Space Runner

The unique aspect of this collection is the integration of an open-world RPG system, allowing players to freely navigate through the games within the game world. Each game maintains its own highscore board and menu options.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to apply the knowledge gained in SDL and create an enjoyable gaming experience for all. The team sought to recreate childhood memories by developing a simple open-world RPG containing beloved classic games. Additionally, the project is designed for easy expansion in the future.

## Project Features

### Main Menu
- Play and Quit buttons for basic functionality.
- Login and Register options for user authentication.
- Tutorial button provides brief descriptions of game controls and objectives.
- Volume control for background music.

### Game Summaries
#### Pacman
- Recreates a simplified version of the classic Pacman game.
- Features various types of food and moving ghosts.
- Implements automatic scoring system and collision detection.

#### Icy Tower
- Requires jumping from platform to platform to avoid falling.
- Introduces increasing platform speed for added challenge.
- Implements running animation and jumping mechanics.

#### Bucket Ball
- Catch falling balls in a bucket to earn points.
- Randomly spawned balls with increasing speed.
- Supports both mouse and keyboard controls.

#### Space Runner
- Navigate through obstacles in a running game.
- Dodge obstacles by jumping and gain lives along the way.
- Features an automatic scoring system.

### High Score Menu
- Each game has its own leaderboard.
- Players can view top scores and attempt to beat them.

## Project Modules
The project is organized into separate header files for each game, including functionalities and structures. A shared `texture_timer.h` file contains the `Texture` and `Timer` classes.

## Team Member Responsibilities
The responsibilities were divided equally between team members. Reyadath focused on the Bucket Ball and Space Runner games, as well as the `dinorun.h` and `bucket_ball.h` files. Ittehad handled the Pacman and Icy Tower games, as well as the `pacman.h` and `tower_game.h` files. Both collaborated on the main function and `texture_timer.h` file.

## Platform, Library & Tools
- Platform: Windows
- Language: C, C++
- Library: SDL2, C++ Standard Library
- Tools: Visual Studio Code, Microsoft Paint

## Limitations
The main limitation faced was the scarcity of available media resources. This affected the visual aspect of the project, and the team had to adapt and make adjustments to the original idea. Additionally, both team members had limited experience with graphics design and photo editing, which affected the overall aesthetics of the game.

## Conclusions
The project provided valuable insights into game development, emphasizing the importance of code aesthetics. Learning how to manipulate media files was a significant learning experience. Both team members intend to improve their graphics design skills for future projects.

## Future Plans
The team aims to expand the collection by adding more games, providing players with a wider variety of nostalgic experiences. Potential future updates include adding new levels, obstacles, in-game currency systems, and enhancing the overall visual appeal of the games.
